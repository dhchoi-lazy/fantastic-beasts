    "image_prompt": "Photo of a traditional Korean 'Bam Seolgi Tteok' (Chestnut Rice Cake), featuring a soft, chewy texture. The rice cake is made by blending finely ground chestnut flour with glutinous rice flour, creating a delicate and slightly sweet flavor. The tteok is cut into neat, bite-sized rectangular pieces, showcasing a pale, creamy color with visible bits of chestnut embedded throughout, giving a speckled appearance. The surface is glossy, indicating the use of honey or syrup in the mix, and the tteok is arranged neatly on a traditional Korean ceramic plate, garnished with a few whole chestnuts on the side for decoration.",
